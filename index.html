    <!--- You can replace the styles.css file with your own styles --->
    <!--- You may also change aspects of the manifest.json file, but it is needed for the PWA to work --->
    <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

    <!--- Declare the icons for the webpage --->
    <link rel="icon" href="icons/masked.png" />

    <!--- The body of your html can go here --->
    <h2>The indecator below shows if you are online of offline.</h2>
    <h2>Go offline and try to reload the page, it should still load perfectly fine!</h2>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Online/Offline Status</h1>

            <h2>How it works...</h2>
            <h4>
                This page, after loading it for the first time, will continue to be able to be loaded even while offline.
                <br>
                This will continue to be the case until you clear the browser's cache. However, if you install this webpage as a PWA, it will have its own cache, and the clearing of the browser's cache will not affect it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Every subsequential visit to this site will load from the cache while also attempting to load from the internet in the background.
                <br>
                This means that in order to update the PWA with new content from the web, you must load the PWA by opening it, thn close it, and open it again.
            </h4>
            <br>
            <h2>Requirements...</h2>
            <h4>
                You first will want to clone <a href="https://github.com/Oshanotter/offline-pwa-example" target="_blank">this repository</a> and change certain aspects about the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files that you want.
                <br>
                Then you can focus on which pages to cache.
                <br>
                <br>
                In order to cache your own pages, you must change the list of <span class="highlight">PRECACHE_URLS</span> found in the <span class="highlight">service-worker.js</span> file.
                <br>
                Any file that you have in that list will automatically be cached and updated when neded.
                <br>
                That should be the only aspect you should change in the service-worker.js file.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, you may want to change certain aspects of the <span class="highlight">manifest.json</span> file.
                <br>
                These aspects are pretty self explanitory, but they are used in case someone tries to install your website as a PWA.

    <!--- I place the script tags here so that they load after the html --->
    <!--- The first tag you need for the PWA to work, you can put your own code into the script.js file though --->
    <script>
        if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
            navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js');
        }
    </script>
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>

</body>
